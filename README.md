# SALOME_tuto
A quick tutorial on how to use the meshing software SALOME and start your first OpenFOAM simulation with more or less “complex” geometry. There are some parameters during the meshing that I did not talk about, so feel free to explore and test the different hypotheses given by this powerful and open-source software.
