# SALOME_tuto
A quick tutorial on how to use the meshing software SALOME and start your first OpenFOAM simulation with more or less “complex” geometry. Some parameters during the meshing process are not covered here, so feel free to explore and test the different hypotheses provided by this powerful open-source software.

The mesh and the geometry are based on the work I carried out during my internship at the Institut Clément-Ader A (ICA-A) [1] in Albi (from 03/03/25 to 31/08/25). The main goal was to simulate the flow of resin passing through a collection of carbon fibers (similar to a prepreg piece) during the compaction process in an autoclave [2].

I used some predefined bash scripts, such as ./Allclean, which can easily be found in the OpenFOAM tutorials. The ./Allrun script, although based on a preexisting template, was customized specifically for this case. I also used the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) terminal to run OpenFOAM on my Windows 11 system.
